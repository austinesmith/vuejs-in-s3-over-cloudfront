# This project creates a portfolio website that automatically deploys to Amazon Web Services

This web SPA (Single Page Application) was created with Vuetify, a JavaScript component manager powered by Vue.js. 
It uses the AWS Cloud Development Kit with TypeScript for automated deployment to Amazon Web Services. 
The CDK automatically provisions an S3 bucket for static hosting behind the CloudFront Content Delivery Network.
It uses Yarn as a package manager and Yarn Workspaces to create a monolithic repository. 
Changes are tracked by Git and Github Actions are used for CI/CD.
